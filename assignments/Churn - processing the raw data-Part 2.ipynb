    "\n",
    "This user is included in the dataset since the expiration date falls within our time period. Since the subscription transaction is 30 days away from 2017-03-15, the previous expiration date, we will count this user as a churned user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a more complex example derive the last one, suppose now a user has the following transaction sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "(2017-01-01, 2017-02-28, false)\n",

    "(2017-04-01, 3017-06-30, false)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above entries is quite typical for a user who changes his subscription plan. Entry 3 indicates that the membership expiration date is moved from 2017-04-03 back to 2017-03-16 due to the user making an active cancellation on the 15th. On April 1st, the user made a long term (two month subscription), which is 15 days after the \"current\" expiration date. So this user is not a churn user.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use pandas groupby aggregate method, we can process columns by each 'msno'. The basic syntax for .agg() is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `groupby().agg({'column name1': [function1,function2, ...],'column name2':[function1,function2, ...],...})`\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply speaking, a dictionary should be passed to agg(), where the key is the column you want to process by groupby columns (here is 'msno'), and value is the function(s) that you want to use to process the column. The values that are passed to the functions are series by say 'msno'. For example, we want to calculate the mean of total songs in the last ten record of each msno, the values of number of total songs listened in the past 10 records are passed to sum() function as a series. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another trick is that you can use multiple functions to a single column, e.g., you can get mean, std, skewness for a column (say,total songs) by specify these functions in a list ['mean','std','skewness'], like:\n",
    "> `groupby('msno').agg({'total_song':['mean','std','skewness']})`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this will create mutilple index for columns, meaning that the names for the new created columns will be multilevel index, the names will be like 'total_song mean','total_song std',... To make all these more readable, you can even create the names for these columns by youselves, to construct another dictionary, such as:\n",
    "> `groupby('msno').agg({'total_song':{'Mean_of_total_song':'mean','Std_of_total_song':'std','Skewness_of_total_song':'skewness'}})`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last tip is that beside using strings to specify aggregate functions (e.g. 'mean','size','std',...) you can define customer functions to meet your needs."
